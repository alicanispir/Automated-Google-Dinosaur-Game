# Automated-Google-Dinosaur-Game
This Python code automatically plays the Google Dinosaur game.

main.py first launches the Google Dinosaur game, where the dinosaur must avoid colliding with cacti by pressing the "up" button. To automate the game, you need to run bot.py in another terminal while the game screen, launched by main.py, remains open.

You can adjust the area where bot.py focuses by checking the test_screenshot.png file. Move the game interface to align with that area so that the modules in pyautogui can detect interactions between the dinosaur and the cactus, triggering the "up" button press.

Enjoy!
